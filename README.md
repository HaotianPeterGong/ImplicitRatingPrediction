# Implicit Rating Prediction
## Intro
Personalized recommendation is the key to attract and retain users. By using an implicit feedback recommendation system, we can deduce user preferences even without their explicit input and improve recommendations for them. This project is to predict the probability of each user that might travel to a specific city by using collaborative filtering of implicit rating.

## Data
Our training set has 970K rows with four columns, and each row represents a user liking a specific city, with a corresponding city and context feature. After EDA and pre-processing, we fed data into various models to learn an implicit user rating. We predicted implicit ratings for 381K user & city cases.

## Competition
This project is a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predicting-implicit-ratings-usfca-2022/overview) on 2022 **Advance Machine Learning** class of M.S. Data Science program at University of San Francisco. I ranked five out of 45 competitors.
