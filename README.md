# Implicit Rating Prediction
## Intro
Personalized recommendation is the key to attract and retain users. By using an implicit feedback recommendation system, we can deduce user preferences even without their explicit input and improve recommendations for them. This project is to predict the probability of each user that might travel to a specific city by using collaborative filtering of implicit rating.
